## Hi there! <img src="cutie.gif" alt="demo gif" width="30"/>

I'm Nori, a freshman Computer Science student based in the Philippines.

This profile serves as documentation for everything I build, experiment with, and work on while completing my degree. 

I am interested in machine learning & artificial intelligence, data science, and full-stack development.
