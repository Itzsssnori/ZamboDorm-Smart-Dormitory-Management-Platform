## Development Timeline  

- **02/25/2026**  
  Started creating the landing page. Distributed the navigation bar, header, body section, footer, and sign-in page into separate HTML and CSS files for clarity and to avoid merge conflicts.  

- **02/26/2026**  
  Completed assigned tasks, uploaded work to individual branches, and merged contributions. Gathered files into a single **index.html** for the landing page. Tweaked responsiveness for different platforms and added comments and indentation for readability.
